==================
The aggdraw module
==================

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/pytroll/aggdraw.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/pytroll/aggdraw

A high-quality graphics engine for PIL, based on Maxim Shemanarev's
Anti-Grain Geometry library (from http://antigrain.com).

The necessary AGG sources are included in the aggdraw source kit.

For posterity, reference `the old documentation
<http://www.effbot.org/zone/aggdraw.htm>`_.

Build instructions (all platforms)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Check prerequisites.

   You need a C++ compiler to build this extension.

   The library comes with the necessary AGG sources included.

   The following additional libraries can be used:

   OpenType/TrueType    freetype2 (2.1.10 or later is recommended)
   support
                        http://www.freetype.org
                        http://freetype.sourceforge.net

2. Configure.

   To enable freetype, you need to build the library somewhere and
   make sure the `freetype-config` command is available on your PATH. The
   setup.py file will call `freetype-config --prefix` to locate
   all of the necessary libraries and headers.

3. Build.

   The library uses a standard setup.py file, and you can use all
   standard setup.py commands.   I recommend the following steps::

        $ python setup.py build_ext -i
        $ python selftest.py

   (if you're lazy, you can skip the above and just install the
   library; setup.py will make sure the right stuff is built before
   it's installed).

4. Install.

   If the selftest succeeds, you can install the library::

        $ python setup.py install

5. Enjoy!
